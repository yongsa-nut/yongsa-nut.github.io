<h3>Advisor Statement:</h3>
<p>The paper under consideration was submitted and accepted to AGI 2016 with full presentation. Artificial General Intelligence Conference or AGI is the premier annual conference in artificial intelligence. The conference brings together an international group of leading academic and industry researchers involved in scientific and engineering work aimed directly toward the goal of Artificial General Intelligence.</p>

<p>Nut did the majority of the work for the paper, contributing significantly to the design, development and write up of the ideas. The work was a first step in Nut’s research on emotion detection and emotion modelling. He is deservedly listed as first author. He has presented the work and handle all communication during the conference. (The presentation can also be viewed <a  href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ByyrBUcjqQ> here </a>.)
