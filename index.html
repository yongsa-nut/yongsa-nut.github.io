            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a lecturer at Thammasat University Rangsit Campus in Thailand. My research interest lies in Affective Computing, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) involving the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and Emotion. 
                I'm interested in both building emotional agents and models as well as understanding human emotion through the lens of computational methods. 
                My current research directions include computational models of emotion and coping and studying and evaluating large language models on emotion capabilities. 
                My research typically relies on the Appraisal Theory of Emotion, where emotions are assumed to arise from the subjective evaluation of events based on personal goals and beliefs.
                I also have braod interests in AI, including markov decision process, reinforcement learning, deep learning, generative AI, and large language and multimodal models. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                I received my PhD. in Computer Science from Northeastern University in May 2021, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Professor Stacy Marsella. 
                My thesis is on computational modeling of emotion and coping where I applied the model to study hurricane evacuation decisions. 
                I received Bachelor's degree in computer science and cognitive science from RPI. Prior to coming to study in the USA, I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand.
