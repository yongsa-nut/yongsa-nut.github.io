<h2>Thesis Proposal</h2>

<p>
Mr. Yongsatianchotâ€™s research is in using multi-agent techniques to model, simulate and predict human sequential decision-making at scale in stressful, emotion-inducing uncertain situations, specifically in the domain of natural disasters.
Each of the committee members touch on different aspects of this research.
<br><br>
Prof. <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/stacy-c-marsella/"> Stacy Marsella </a> (advisor) works on the computational modeling of human cognitive and social behavior, both at the individual level and at the level of large scale multi-agent social simuations.
<br>
Prof. <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/camato/">Christopher Amato</a> (internal committee) is an expert in multi-agent systems and modeling decision-making under uncertainty and partial observability.
<br>
Prof. <a href="http://www.mie.neu.edu/people/griffin-jacqueline">Jacqueline Griffin</a> (internal committee) is an expert on modeling decision making in health and humanitarian systems in the presence of multiple competing objectives, including response to natural disasters.
<br>
Prof. <a href="http://ict.usc.edu/profile/jonathan-gratch/">Jonathan Gratch</a> (external committee) is an expert in modeling the impact of emotion on human behavior.
